# Most Trending YouTube Video Pattern
Just another repository

Hello, this is the project about the most trending YouTube video pattern as we trying to investigate the pattern of trending video through the number of view, likes, dislikes and comments based on three main categories entertainment, music and blog.


# Data Mining Project
# Hypothesis From Datasets
1. What is the average views, likes,dislikes and comments from the datasets?
2. What will happen to the number of views, comments and dislikes if the number of likes is higher?
3. Is the category with high number of views can have high number of comments?
4. Is the category with high number of views can have high number of dislikes?
5. In average, is the category with high number of views can have high number of comments?


# Explatory Data Analysis Steps and Examples
Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is the first and foremost of all tasks that a dataset goes through. EDA lets us understand the data and thus helping us to prepare it for the upcoming tasks. 

**1. Import the datasets**

**2. Identifying the Summary of the DataFrame**

**3. Visualisations using PowerBI**

**4. Answer the questions based on visualisations**


# Data Preprocessing

**1. Data Cleaning Through Excel**

**2. Data Cleaning Through RapidMiner**



# Steps in Developing the Descriptive Data Mining Solution

A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment. For my project, I choose clustering method as the method for the process and kMeans is the model of machine learning algorithm. Following are the steps in developing the descriptive data mining solution:

1. Randomly select k centroids, where k is the number of cluster you chose. In our project, we have 3 cluster.
2. Maximization step computes the mean of all the points for each cluster and sets the new centroid.



# Steps in Developing the Predictive Data Mining Solution

Predictive is the process by which information is extracted from existing datasets for determining patterns and predicting the forthcoming trends or outcomes. For this project, I choose classification method as the method for the process with three classifiers. 

1. Import required libraries
2. Import and upload file into Google Colab
3. Load data and read file that has been imported.
4. Divide given columns into two types of variables dependent (or target variable) and independent variable (or feature variables)
5. Import required classifier 
6. Print the accuracy of the model (Decision Tree and Random Forest)
7. Record the result.

# Conclusion 

We provides the full results based on best trending, moderate trending and worst trending that mostly influenced from the views from each videos. The stakeholders can measure the performance of their marketing strategy through YouTube videos as we have provided the accurate metric based on the clusters in this project.
